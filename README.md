### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm Glitch752, and I love learning new things!  
Most of the projects on my Github are to learn new concepts like frameworks, programming languages, concepts, etc.  
  
Feel free to check out, or contribute to, some of my miscellaneous projects. I do all different types of programming.  

I've had many contributions to private repositories recently: I'm starting some big projects! I'll hopefully release them soon.
