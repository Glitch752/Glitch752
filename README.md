### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm Glitch752, and I love learning new things!  
Most of the projects on my Github are to learn new concepts like frameworks, programming languages, concepts, etc.  
  
Feel free to check out some of my miscellaneous projects. I do all different types of programming.  

I'm still learning git, as you can see from the days Github shows very incorrect contribution amounts. I wish I could commit 100+ times in a single day!
