### Hi there!

I'm Brody, and I love learning new things!  
Most of my projects here are partially or fully made to learn new concepts.  
Feel free to check out or contribute to my miscellaneous projects. I do all different types of programming.

My current biggest interests include graphics programming, simulation, compilers, and embedded systems.  

I've been making contributions every day for a while now, and while I don't have any strict "rules" in this self-imposed challenge, I try to make somewhat meaningful code contributions every day. Occasionally, it's just something simple like documentation tweaks, though :)
