### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  
I'm Glitch752, and I love learning new things!  
Most of the projects on my Github are to learn new concepts like frameworks, programming languages, concepts, etc.  
  
Feel free to check out some of my miscellaneous projects. I do all different types of programming.  

I'm still learning git, as you can see from the days I have 100+ commits because of a messed up `git rebase`!
